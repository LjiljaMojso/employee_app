# Employees App

## General Information

Assignment is
Create an application for hiring a team of developers. This application should provide functionality for browsing, adding, updating and deleting developer’s profiles and managing the hiring process.
As a user of that system, I should be able to:
List, create, edit and delete developer’s profiles.
The system doesn’t have to make a difference between types of users (administrators, normal users, etc). For the sake of simplicity, everyone who is using the system can both manage developer’s profiles and hire them.
Each developer’s profile has the following information:

Name - required

Email - required

Phone number - required

Location - required

Profile picture (could be a simple url) - optional

Price per hour - required

Technology (one of “Javascript”, “Java”, “.NET”, “Flutter”, “Python”, “PHP”) - required

Description - optional

Years of experience - required

Native language (one of “English”, “Serbian”, “Bulgarian”) - required

Linkedin profile link - optional

## Technologies Used

- ReactJs
- Firebase
- TalwindCss

## Project Status

Project is: _in progress_

## Room for Improvement

To do:

- Feature to be added: hiring process (Select one or multiple developers and hire them for a specified period of time.)

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
